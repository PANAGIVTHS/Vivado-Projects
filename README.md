# Verilog Projects

This repository contains basic projects written in Verilog, created as part of my learning journey into Hardware Description Languages (HDL). 

## About
These projects explore fundamental concepts in digital design and serve as practice for writing and understanding Verilog code.

## Projects
Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific aspect of HDL programming, such as:
- Basic combinational and sequential circuits
- Simulation and testing using testbenches
- Learning key Verilog constructs and best practices
